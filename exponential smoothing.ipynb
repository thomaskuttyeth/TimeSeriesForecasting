    "## Single Exponential Smoothing\n",
    "Single Exponential Smoothing, SES for short, also called Simple Exponential Smoothing, is a time series forecasting method for univariate data without a trend or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires a single parameter, called alpha (a), also called the smoothing factor or smoothing coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter controls the rate at which the influence of the observations at prior time steps decay exponentially. Alpha is often set to a value between 0 and 1. Large values mean that the model pays attention mainly to the most recent past observations, whereas smaller values mean more of the history is taken into account when making a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* smaller $alpha$ gives more smoothing , and larger $alpha$ gives less smoothing. \n"
