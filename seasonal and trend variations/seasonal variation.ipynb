    "A seasonal index of 1.3 (or 130%) would indicate that that season had 30% more than the seasonal average. An example is where Christopher works all throughout the year at a ice-cream shop and earns an average of 100,000 a season for it. If the seasonal index for summer was 1.5, then that means Christopher earns 50% more than the average 100,000.  Likewise a seasonal index of 0.6 in winter would indicate that Christopher earns 40% less than the seasonal average."
