simple exponential smoothing 
===========================================
The main idea is forecasting future values using a weighted average of all previous values in the series 
The main use is the time series forecasting with no trend and no seasonal variations. 

Three types of exponential smoothing
    * simple - for no trend or seasonality 
    * holt's exponential smoothing for series with trend no seasonality 
    * winters exponential smoothing - for series with trend and seasonality 

simple - ses 
===================
makes the assumption that the seies contains only level(lt) 
forcast = estimated level at most recent time point 

l_t = alpha * y_t + (1-alpha) l_t-1 
alpha = smoothing constant 

weights decrease exponentially into the past .... 

usually we take 0.1, 0.2 
minimize rmse or map of training 

beauty of ses 
======================================
forcasts use all previous values 
but we only need to store the most recent forecast and its error. 
Unlike MA, gives more weight to more recent observations
